# Welcome in this Microcks Workshop!

APIs are the cornerstone of so many recent breakthroughs: from mobile applications, to the Internet of Things, to cloud computing. All those technologies expose, consume, and are built on APIs. And those APIs are a key driver for generating new revenue. Salesforce generates 50% of its revenue through APIs, Expedia generates 90% of its, and eBay generates 60% of its. With APIs becoming so central, it becomes essential to deal with Mocking and Testing. The success of your digital transformation project depends on it!

This workshop presents the mocking and testing activities of the full API lifecycle management that can guide you from an idea to the realization, from the inception of an API program up to management at scale throughout your whole company.
