# Conclusion

Red Hat technologies and communities can help with full API lifecycle management. The diagram below shows tools for full API lifecycle management:

![Tools for the API Lifecycle](/overview/api-lifecycle/tools.png)

Communities such as Apicurio and Microcks will help you with the design, mock, and tests. A whole development offering such as Red Hat Fuse, Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, or Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces can help you develop reliable API back ends. Red Hat Ansible Automation can help you with the Continuous Delivery of your APIs. Red Hat Single Sign-On can help secure your APIs, and Red Hat 3scale API Management handles the rest of the API lifecycle. Last but not least, Red Hat can help you define your API strategy through a service offering: the API Model Canvas.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a the core of this lifecycle, since it is the component that brings agility and makes this approach flow more easily.
